america is not defined by our borders . we are defined by a common creed . in this holiday season , it ’ s worth remembering that “ we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that we are endowed by our creator by certain inalienable rights , that among these are the right to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness . ”
so that 's why i came here today . because if success can happen here at booker t. washington , it can happen anywhere in memphis . and if it can happen in memphis , it can happen anywhere in tennessee . and it can happen anywhere in tennessee , it can happen all across america .
if and when the vatican is attacked by isis , which as everyone knows is isis ’ s ultimate trophy , i can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that donald trump would have been president because this would not have happened . isis would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk , no action politicians .
japan is doing very well too . they ’ re killing caterpillar . you know , they ’ re ordering komatsu tractors now because they ’ ve devalued – look , you take a look at what ’ s happened to the yen and it ’ s very hard .
we 're directing unprecedented resources to treating the signature wounds of today 's wars -- traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder . and i recently signed into law the caregivers and veterans omnibus health services act . that 's a long name , but let me tell you what it does . it not only improves treatment for traumatic brain injury and ptsd , it gives new support to many of the caregivers who put their own lives on hold to care for their loved one .
great guy . phil said , `` donald , '' —like for the last three months he ’ s driving me crazy , he said— '' donald , i want to put $ 10 million into your campaign .
but what i ’ ve said to members of congress is that if , in fact , we ’ re serious about trying to resolve this diplomatically -- because no matter how good our military is , military options are always messy , they ’ re always difficult , always have unintended consequences , and in this situation are never complete in terms of making us certain that they don ’ t then go out and pursue even more vigorously nuclear weapons in the future -- if we ’ re serious about pursuing diplomacy , then there ’ s no need for us to add new sanctions on top of the sanctions that are already very effective and that brought them to the table in the first place .
and there ’ s so many more . you have corporate inversions . you have people who can ’ t get their money back into the country because the politicians can ’ t get along . they can ’ t make a deal .
so when i started this whole quest – i mean , who knew it was going to turn into this ? it ’ s been an amazing thing . no matter where i go , i have tremendous crowds , packed crowds , packed .
remember , they signed up for it . michelle always reminds me of that . the problem is that this kind of vilification and over-the-top rhetoric closes the door to the possibility of compromise . it undermines democratic deliberation .
opportunity is who we are . and the defining project of our generation is to restore that promise . we know where to start : the best measure of opportunity is access to a good job . with the economy picking up speed , companies say they intend to hire more people this year . and over half of big manufacturers say they 're thinking of insourcing jobs from abroad .
fences are easy , believe me . i saw the other day on television people just walking across the border . they 're walking . the military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front , coming into our country .
they go out and in terms of , you know , surveillance , they have the right to self-inspect . how about that ? on their major , most dangerous they can self-inspect . we ’ re going to let them self-inspect . and then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we ’ re all good with contracts don ’ t start until such and such happens . it could be forever before you ever go into inspect .
thank you . god bless you , and god bless america . to chip , kathy , and nancy , who graciously shared your father with a nation that loved him ; to walter 's friends , colleagues , protégés , and all who considered him a hero ; to the men of the intrepid ; to all of you who are gathered here today ; i am honored to be here to pay tribute to the life and times of the man who chronicled our time .
and he said , `` would you ever think of maybe skipping iowa going right to new hampshire ? and then you ’ d go to south carolina '' where i ’ m leading by massive – yeah , you ’ ve got to see the rallies there . they ’ re incredible .
and if , in fact , we defend the legal right of a person to insult another 's religion , we 're equally obligated to use our free speech to condemn such insults -- and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with religious communities , particularly religious minorities who are the targets of such attacks .
the plan also extends unemployment insurance for another year . if the millions of unemployed americans stopped getting this insurance , and stopped using that money for basic necessities , it would be a devastating blow to this economy .
i do have to know the name of the group because , who knows ? i mean , they have to give me the name of the group . but right after , when i reviewed it , i put out a tweet and i put out on facebook that i totally disavow .
these laws also have the potential of violating the rights of innocent american citizens and legal residents , making them subject to possible stops or questioning because of what they look like or how they sound . and as other states and localities go their own ways , we face the prospect that different rules for immigration will apply in different parts of the country -- a patchwork of local immigration rules where we all know one clear national standard is needed .
second , no american company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas . from now on , every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax . and every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in america .
we ’ re terminating common core , and you will see something that ’ s magic . and i ’ ve seen it where parents and all of these people – the uncles , the aunts – they ’ re all on the school boards . they get professionals . they have great principals .
you know , hillary wanted to approve it but she ’ s been dragged so far left , that ’ s she ’ s – forget it . it ’ s a disaster . so i would approve it .
of course , some countries don ’ t have this problem . if the central government wants a railroad , they build a railroad , no matter how many homes get bulldozed . if they don ’ t want a bad story in the newspaper , it doesn ’ t get written .
and i want us to think about access to higher education and affordability of higher education in that same way . i want us to all organize together -- not on a partisan basis , it ’ s not organizing around an election , it ’ s organizing around a simple idea that everybody should be able to get behind .
for even as too many were out there chasing ever-bigger bonuses and short-term profits over the last decade , we continued to neglect the long-term threats to our prosperity : the crushing burden that the rising cost of health care is placing on families and businesses ; the failure of our education system to prepare our workers for a new age ; the progress that other nations are making on clean energy industries and technologies while we -- we remain addicted to foreign oil ; the growing debt that we 're passing on to our children . even after we emerge from the current recession , these challenges will still represent major obstacles that stand in the way of our success in the 21st century . so we 've got a lot of work to do .
when i hear that we 'll never overcome the racial divide in our politics , i think about that republican woman who used to work for strom thurmond , who 's now devoted to educating inner-city children , and who went out into the streets of south carolina and knocked on doors for this campaign . do n't tell me we ca n't change .
and the veterans administration is run by obama just as incompetently as he ’ s running our country . you look at the tsa , you look at what ’ s going on at the airports and you look at that . okay ? just take a look at that . that ’ s like the veterans administration .
but we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours . i don ’ t know how they ’ re doing this but they do it . they find a way .
you know , that libya – isis has all that oil from gaddafi , all of that big oil from gaddafi . he took it . we ’ re like a bunch of dummies .
so here we are , more than half a century later , once again facing the challenges of a new age . here we are , once more marching toward an unknown future , what i call the joshua generation to their moses generation -- the great inheritors of progress paid for with sweat and blood , and sometimes life itself .
but we told him he can ’ t do that . that was the first real problem i had with him ... now , i said a common sense conservative and today i heard he used the term because the press was up and they interviewed me and they said he said he ’ s a common sense conservative .
as i said yesterday , the small business administration has stepped in to help businesses by approving loans , but also as important , allowing many to defer existing loan payments . a lot of folks are still loaded up with loans that they had from katrina and other natural disasters down here , so they may need some additional help .
what eisenhower did to record these crimes for history is what we are doing here today . that 's what elie wiesel and the survivors we honor here do by fighting to make their memories part of our collective memory . that 's what the holocaust museum does every day on our national mall , the place where we display for the world our triumphs and failures and the lessons we 've learned from our history . it 's the very opposite of silence .
we ’ re also requiring insurers to extend current plans to inform their customers about two things . one , that protections -- what protections these renewed plans don ’ t include . and number two , that the marketplace offers new options with better coverage and tax credits that might help you bring down the cost .
and we won in a landslide and we won the evangelicals . i ’ ve won just about i think almost every place i ’ ve won with evangelicals . and it ’ s been an amazing time .
but most importantly , it ’ s a great chance to see the incredible men and women who , every single day , are helping to keep america safe and are just the bedrock of this country ’ s manufacturing base . thank you to all of you .
beyondpakistan , there is a core of terrorists – probably in the tens of thousands – who have made their choice to attack america . so the second step in my strategy will be to build our capacity and our partnerships to track down , capture or kill terrorists around the world , and to deny them the world ’ s most dangerous weapons .
and then they ’ d come in , `` sir , your poll number went up 9 points this week . '' i said , `` they did ? '' because i have to do what ’ s right . i have to do what ’ s right .
we can not continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer . many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions .
that includes , by the way , our commitment to social security . while social security is not the cause of our deficit , it faces real long-term challenges in a country that ’ s growing older . as i said in the state of the union , both parties should work together now to strengthen social security for future generations . but we have to do it without putting at risk current retirees , or the most vulnerable , or people with disabilities ; without slashing benefits for future generations ; and without subjecting americans ’ guaranteed retirement income to the whims of the stock market . and it can be done .
the american people may have voted for divided government , but they didn ’ t vote for a dysfunctional government . so i ’ m asking you all to make your voice heard . if you want a balanced approach to reducing the deficit , let your member of congress know . if you believe we can solve this problem through compromise , send that message .
you take a look . i said that in scotland and in the u.k. , that was going to happen . i was the one that predicted it . and everybody said , he 's wrong , he 's wrong . president obama said , if it happens , they 're going to get to the back of the line , which probably is one of the reasons they lost , because i consider it a win . i think it was a win for them , actually , because they do n't want to be told what to do . and they do n't want to be told that when people pour into the country , they have to take them even if they 're not qualified , even if they do n't have paperwork , even if they have no idea where they come from .
the surest way to increase our leverage against iran in the long- run is to stop bankrolling its ambitions . that will depend on achieving my fourth goal : ending the tyranny of oil in our time .
that means that -- even after boston -- we do not deport someone or throw somebody in prison in the absence of evidence . that means putting careful constraints on the tools the government uses to protect sensitive information , such as the state secrets doctrine . and that means finally having a strong privacy and civil liberties board to review those issues where our counterterrorism efforts and our values may come into tension .
i ’ ve had some moments where it ’ s not looking so good , and it ’ s not a great feeling . and so i understand how ted feels and heidi and their whole beautiful family .
i mean , it ’ s sort of interesting because i see when i turn on the television , i see these ads about myself by crooked people . i see these ads and they ’ re mostly wrong . a little bit sometimes are right but they ’ re all negative . you know . and i ’ m looking , i ’ m watching this on television – ad after ad .
we have to figure it out . we have to figure out what is going on . was it training ? was it something else ? it could have been something else . we have to take care of everybody .
we believe we can be even closer partners in ensuring our mutual security . and both our nations have known the anguish of terrorism , and we stand united in the defense of our people . and now we 're deepening our defense cooperation against new challenges . the united states welcomes a greater role for india in the asia pacific , where the freedom of navigation must be upheld and disputes must be resolved peacefully . and even as we acknowledge the world as it is , we must never stop working for the world as it should be -- a world without nuclear weapons . that should be a goal for all of us .
the inner cities will remain poor . the factories will remain closed . the borders will remain open . the special interests will remain firmly in control . hillary clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare america into thinking small – and they want to scare the american people out of voting for a better future .
but we also heard from some unexpected people . in particular , i started getting a lot of letters from kids . four of them are here today -- grant fritz , julia stokes , hinna zeejah , and teja goode . they ’ re pretty representative of some of the messages that i got . these are some pretty smart letters from some pretty smart young people .
and i think the fact that obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves israel to support this guy or even the democratic party is impossible to believe . i think it will be one of the great catastrophes .
i didn ’ t need to do this . this is not so easy . and i had no idea . you know , maybe none of us did . you know , i had no idea the message was going to get across . it ’ s a message of competence . it really is . it ’ s a message of common sense and it ’ s a message of competence .
sometimes young people are known as just consumers of goods , but we want young people creating the new products , the next big thing that will change how we live our lives . that 's the agenda that i want to pursue .
…boy , oh , boy . i didn ’ t expect that . you know , joe [ arends ] and the group [ veterans for a strong america ] called and they said `` would you come over and speak ? ''
and our politics has suffered . entrenched interests , those who benefit from an unjust status quo , resisted any government efforts to give working families a fair deal -- marshaling an army of lobbyists and opinion makers to argue that minimum wage increases or stronger labor laws or taxes on the wealthy who could afford it just to fund crumbling schools , that all these things violated sound economic principles .
tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another . our campaign received more primary votes than any gop campaign in history , no matter who it is , no matter who they are , we received more votes . this is a great feeling . that ’ s a great feeling .
i -- i do n't know what party these men and women belong to . i do n't know if they 'll vote for me . but i know that their spirit defines us . they remind me , in the words of scripture , that ours is a future filled with hope . and if you share that faith with me , if you share that hope with me , i ask you tonight for your vote .
so if people are looking for an excuse not to do the right thing on immigration reform , they can always find an excuse -- we ’ ve run out of time , or this is hard , or the list goes on and on .
thank you . thank you . we ’ re going to be tough and we ’ re going to be smart and we ’ re going to do it right . america will be a tolerant and open society . america will also be a safe society . we will protect our borders at home . we will defeat isis overseas . we have no choice . we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety . we will make america rich again . we will make america safe again . we will make america great again . thank you . thank you very much . thank you very much .
woman : so we thank you . god bless you . and just , you know , he ’ s a mexican-american , and you because of your efforts have sent him to college . and i have been writing letters to him for when i ’ m in heaven to tell him that what you ’ ve done for him now he has a great responsibility to pay it forward just as you have done for us .
america , we are passing through a time of great trial . and the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear : that our cause is just , our resolve unwavering . we will go forward with the confidence that right makes might , and with the commitment to forge an america that is safer , a world that is more secure , and a future that represents not the deepest of fears but the highest of hopes .
now , i ’ ve cut taxes for those who need it -- middle-class families , small businesses -- but i don ’ t believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores , or pay down our deficit . i don ’ t believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy , or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of china . after all we ’ ve been through , i don ’ t believe that rolling back regulations on wall street will help the small businesswoman expand , or the laid-off construction worker keep his home . we have been there . we ’ ve tried that . and we ’ re not going back . we are moving forward , america .
that 's why this campaign ca n't only be about me . it must be about us . it must be about what we can do together . this campaign must be the occasion , the vehicle , of your hopes , and your dreams . it will take your time , your energy , and your advice to push us forward when we 're doing right , and let us know when we 're not . this campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship , restoring our sense of common purpose , and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change .
we may go at it in campaign season , but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred ; that it ’ s being denied to too many -- and that on this 50th anniversary of the great march from selma to montgomery and the passage of the voting rights act , we can come together , democrats and republicans , to make voting easier for every single american .
now , he 's totally in favor of common core ; that 's a disaster , that 's bad , it should be local and all of that . but he 's totally in favor of common core .
in the united states -- a nation made up of people who crossed oceans to start anew -- we ’ re naturally drawn to the idea of finding freedom in our land . to african americans , the story of the exodus was perhaps the central story , the most powerful image about emerging from the grip of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity -- a tale that was carried from slavery through the civil rights movement into today .
and i see hillary clinton said , i do not like donald trump 's tone . look , here is the story . i think i have a great temperament . she uses the word temperament but i love when she uses the word tone .
while under heavy enemy fire , specialist giunta immediately sprinted towards cover and engaged the enemy . seeing that his squad leader had fallen , and believing that he had been injured , specialist giunta exposed himself to withering enemy fire and raced towards his squad leader , helped him to cover and administered medical aid .
…but you know , if you think about it and you ’ ll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what . they ’ re just troublemakers , et cetera , et cetera . but most people aren ’ t and they believe something . and i have some very smart friends don ’ t agree with me ; they agree with the other side .
hillary clinton turned the state department into her private hedge fund – the russians , the saudis , the chinese – all gave money to bill and hillary and got favorable treatment in return . it ’ s a sad day in america when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens .
at home , i 've taken executive actions to fix as much of our broken immigration system as i can , which includes trying to help people come out of the shadows so that they can live and work in a country that they call home . and that includes hundreds of thousands of young people we call dreamers , who have already received temporary relief . and i ’ m remaining committed to working with our congress on comprehensive immigration reform .
some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer . but i actually believe they ’ ll do better because i think the economy will grow . it will grow rapidly . and we ’ ll have something very special .
so he ’ s sort of got the worst of all elements . he ’ s an insider totally but he can get nothing done . okay ? he can get nothing done . your new speaker – how do you like paul ryan ? how do you like him ?
but the one game changer that we have to be careful with , that we never really had to think about too much before , other than a cetain number of years ago , is the nuclear . nuclear today , it 's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles . you can take out the east coast of this country , you can take out large sections of the midwest , you can take out things that were unthinkable . the power . and we have to be in a position where that never , ever , ever , every happens . we 've never had this before .
massive trade deficits subtract directly from our gross domestic product . from 1947 to 2001 – a span of over five decades – our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5 % .
teddy walked into a meeting with a plain manila envelope , and showed only the chairman that it was filled with the texan 's favorite cigars . when the negotiations were going well , he would inch the envelope closer to the chairman .
for us to change that contract we 've made with the american people rather than look at options like closing loopholes for corporations that they do n't need , that points to a long-term trend in which we have fundamentally , i think , undermined what people expect out of this government -- which is that parties sit down , they negotiate , they compromise , but they also reflect the will of the american people ; that you do n't have one narrow faction that is able to simply dictate 100 percent of what they want all the time or otherwise threaten that we destroy the american economy
you know , when you have so many people running – we had 17 and then they started to drop . ding . bing . i love it . i love it . and you ’ ll be losing a lot over the next little while . i would imagine . i don ’ t know . when somebody ’ s down at zero i would think that eventually they ’ ll drop out . the only difference is there ’ s nothing to pick up if there is zero . what do you pick up ? so anyways you ’ ll be seeing that .
but in two seconds , they give me whatever i wanted . so i have a total net worth , and now with the increase , it ’ ll be well-over $ 10 billion . but here , a total net worth of — net worth , not assets , not — a net worth , after all debt , after all expenses , the greatest assets — trump tower , 1290 avenue of the americas , bank of america building in san francisco , 40 wall street , sometimes referred to as the trump building right opposite the new york — many other places all over the world .
we sell them beef . beef . and then they don ’ t want it . because you know , do you ever see what ’ s going on over there ? we sell the beef and it goes over there and it ’ s very perishable . so by the time it gets over there , then they turn it over `` we don ’ t want it . ''
that has to be the attitude our country has . you can ’ t spend millions and millions of dollars on doing something that you can do for $ 2,000 . you know , when you look at costs , we just spent $ 1 million building a soccer field . okay ? a soccer field for our prisoners that happen to be in guantanamo . okay ? i don ’ t like that . what do you need $ 1 million for ? level out the surface , let them play – if they had to play at all . okay ? what do you need to spend $ 1 million .
so i would ’ ve said they would have had a million or two . so i say they have 24 million people . and i say , well now the second debate , which is on cnn – that was on fox , maybe i should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity . does that make sense ? all to charity . all to charity .
on energy policy , america first means opening up america ’ s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration .
simply put , american innovation must be the foundation of american power -- because at no time in human history has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained its military and political primacy . and so that means that the civilians among us , as parents and community leaders , elected officials , business leaders , we have a role to play . we can not leave it to those in uniform to defend this country -- we have to make sure that america is building on its strengths .
i believe we start by doing what we are doing today -- by bearing witness , by fighting the silence that is evil 's greatest co-conspirator . in the face of horrors that defy comprehension , the impulse to silence is understandable . my own great uncle returned from his service in world war ii in a state of shock , saying little , alone with painful memories that would not leave his head .
the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in . the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans .
and ashley said that when she was 9 years old , her mother got cancer . and because she had to miss days of work , she was let go and lost her health care .
well , the chairman asked if he could come up . you saw him . he was here a little while ago . and i was greatly honored that he did come up frankly .
those are the voices that still echo through the streets of prague . those are the ghosts of 1968. those were the joyful sounds of the velvet revolution . those were the czechs who helped bring down a nuclear-armed empire without firing a shot .
so here ’ s the truth . around two-thirds of our budget -- two-thirds -- is spent on medicare , medicaid , social security , and national security . two-thirds . programs like unemployment insurance , student loans , veterans ’ benefits , and tax credits for working families take up another 20 percent . what ’ s left , after interest on the debt , is just 12 percent for everything else . that ’ s 12 percent for all of our national priorities -- education , clean energy , medical research , transportation , our national parks , food safety , keeping our air and water clean -- you name it -- all of that accounts for 12 percent of our budget .
second , this contributed to a larger failure of analysis -- a failure to connect the dots of intelligence that existed across our intelligence community and which , together , could have revealed that abdulmutallab was planning an attack .
so i said , `` i agree . except for one thing from a practical standpoint , it ’ s too much . most of these people aren ’ t paying anyway . '' what i want to do is bring our jobs back from china , bring our jobs back from mexico , bring fairness to our deals as an example with japan .
by the end of this decade , two in three job openings will require some higher education -- two in three . and yet , we still live in a country where too many bright , striving americans are priced out of the education they need . it ’ s not fair to them , and it ’ s sure not smart for our future . that ’ s why i ’ m sending this congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college -- to zero .
this could be the all-time great trojan horse . who knows ? i have as big a heart as anybody . we want to help them . we want to build safe zones in syria .
what a crowd . what a crowd . thank you all very much . we love our country . we love our country . but we can turn this all around . we ’ re going to do it by putting america first .
remember that . but we have to also -- we have to get to the bottom of things . we have to . but we can never , ever forget the hundreds of thousands of great deals and great things that our police all over the country do , and nobody recognizes them for what they do .
i have the greatest people in the world for dealing . we use political hacks that don ’ t know what they ’ re doing . they ’ re dealing against the smartest people in china , the smartest people in japan , the smartest people from all over the world , and our negotiators are political hacks and we ’ re not using them anymore .
you know , the drug companies and all of the – because if you would see the kind of waste , fraud , and corruption in the united states , a lot of it isn ’ t really waste , fraud , and corruption .
yesterday , the white house announced that in the first month , more than 100,000 americans successfully enrolled in new insurance plans . is that as high a number as we ’ d like ? absolutely not . but it does mean that people want affordable health care . the problems of the website have prevented too many americans from completing the enrollment process . and that ’ s on us , not on them . but there is no question that there ’ s real demand for quality , affordable health insurance .
one of the great musicians said `` you get the largest crowds of any single human being on earth without a guitar '' meaning who doesn ’ t count on music . so it ’ s true , we ’ ve had tremendous response . we ’ ve had incredible response .
and remember this , this is a six-year – you have a six year statute of limitations . so she ’ s fighting for her life . if she doesn ’ t become president , she could have a real problem . does that make any sense to anybody ? does that make sense to anybody ?
he doesn ’ t say anything about education . he doesn ’ t say that he ’ s there because he likes barack obama , or he ’ s proud of the possibility of the first african american president .
now , on some issues , like the recovery act , we 've found common cause . on other issues , we 've had some pretty strong disagreements . but i 'm here today because i am convinced , as tom mentioned in his introduction , that we can and we must work together . whatever differences we may have , i know that all of us share a deep , abiding belief in this country , a belief in our people , a belief in the principles that have made america 's economy the envy of the world .
so that ’ s what immigration reform looks like : smarter enforcement ; a pathway to earned citizenship ; improvements to our legal system . they ’ re all common-sense steps . they ’ ve got bipartisan support . they ’ ve got the support of a broad cross-section of leaders from every walk of life . so there ’ s no reason congress can ’ t get this done by the end of the summer .
what makes america exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on earth -- the belief that our destiny is shared ; that this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another , and to future generations ; that the freedom which so many americans have fought for and died for comes with responsibilities as well as rights , and among those are love and charity and duty and patriotism . that 's what makes america great .
but hillary clinton — think of it . i say so chuck , report it like properly . trust me , they don ’ t want to run against trump . the last thing she wants in her whole life is — this was only — i did this in , like , 15 minutes what happened to them , because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husband ’ s one of the great abusers of the world ? give me a break . give me a break .
let me also say this : the promotion of human rights can not be about exhortation alone . at times , it must be coupled with painstaking diplomacy . i know that engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of indignation . but i also know that sanctions without outreach -- condemnation without discussion -- can carry forward only a crippling status quo . no repressive regime can move down a new path unless it has the choice of an open door .
i ’ ve visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools . i ’ ve seen our dilapidated airports , highways , bridges , and i ’ ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours . it ’ s really not to be believed . hard to imagine what ’ s happened to our country .
and finally , to help spark prosperity in both out countries , let ’ s truly invest in innovation , and research and development together . here in mexico , you ’ re now a global leader in graduating engineers and technicians . one of mexico ’ s leading scientists , rafael navarro-gonzález , is helping analyze data from the rover that we landed on mars .
2014 was the planet ’ s warmest year on record . now , one year doesn ’ t make a trend , but this does : 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century .
and you know , my whole fame is and i ’ ll say it once . we will make america truly great again . and thank you very much . thank you everybody . thank you . thank you very much !
and most of all , we 've got to break the gridlock in washington that ’ s been preventing us from taking the action we need to get this country moving . that ’ s why , next week , i ’ ll be speaking to the nation about a plan to create jobs and reduce our deficit -- a plan that i want to see passed by congress .
and you know what ? it ’ s the only thing you can do . there ’ s nothing else . because otherwise how are you going to get them to stop ? and then you have the devaluation with china . the all-time . they ’ re like grand chess masters or grand – i mean these people are the greatest – the greatest in history . they ’ re grandmasters of that – devaluation . they devalue their currency .
so they 're very tired of it . but i want to thank all of those people that — delegates that were on the different committees , because , boy , was that something . did we show them something . and unfortunately , the vote was very late . but essentially , we had 112- 12. this was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we 're going to have a big fight . we 're not going to have a fight . people agree with what we 've — they want the wall . they want the borders . they want these things to happen .
we believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world . and today , our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record . our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high . more americans finish college than ever before .
but as i soon discovered , his passion for the senate ’ s past , his mastery of even its most arcane procedures , it wasn ’ t an obsession with the trivial or the obscure . it reflected a profoundly noble impulse , a recognition of a basic truth about this country that we are not a nation of men , we are a nation of laws . our way of life rests on our democratic institutions . precisely because we are fallible , it falls to each of us to safeguard these institutions , even when it ’ s inconvenient , and pass on our republic more perfect than before .
but you know what i ’ ll be ? i ’ ll be the great at the military . i ’ ll be so good . and i ’ ll know when – and i ’ ll build our military so strong , so tough , so incredible , nobody ’ s going to mess around . we ’ re never going to have to use it . we ’ re never going to have to use it .
we can ’ t even go there . iran is taking over iraq . with the money that we ’ re giving them , they ’ re going to take off and they ’ re going to get the oil , they ’ re going to get everything . the oil they don ’ t get isis is getting . what do we get ? nothing . we get nothing . we got far less than nothing .
and on a personal note , i have been part of that generation so inspired by the space program . 1961 was the year of my birth -- the year that kennedy made his announcement . and one of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather ’ s shoulders , waving a flag as astronauts arrived in hawaii . for me , the space program has always captured an essential part of what it means to be an american -- reaching for new heights , stretching beyond what previously did not seem possible . and so , as president , i believe that space exploration is not a luxury , it ’ s not an afterthought in america ’ s quest for a brighter future -- it is an essential part of that quest .
social tensions will rise , as various groups fight to hold on to what they have , or start blaming somebody else for why their position isn ’ t improving . and the fundamental optimism that ’ s always propelled us forward will give way to cynicism or nostalgia .
and then we got hit at the world trade center and the pentagon . again , the worst attack on our country in its history . our foreign policy goals must be based on america ’ s core national security interests . and the following will be my priorities .
so every family in this state was shaken by the tragedy of that morning . every family in this country was shaken . we hugged our kids more tightly . we asked what could we do , as a society , to help prevent a tragedy like that from happening again .
that is how we 'll stay true to our better history while reaching for the day of peace and justice that is to come . these are the beliefs that guide us , the values that inspire us , the principles that bind us together as free peoples who still believe the words of dr. martin luther king jr. -- that `` injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . ''
we know that we ’ d all be better off if we invest in science and technology that sparks new businesses and medical breakthroughs ; if we developed more clean energy so we could use less foreign oil and reduce the carbon pollution that ’ s threatening our planet .
of course , danny didn ’ t always take credit for the difference he made . ever humble , one of the only landmarks that bear his name is a marine corps mess hall in hawaii . and when someone asked him how he wanted to be remembered , danny said , “ i represented the people of hawaii and this nation honestly and to the best of my ability . i think i did okay . ”
as we ’ ve seen , that harms all of us so by enacting these reforms , we ’ ll help ensure that our financial system -- and our economy -- continues to be the envy of the world . that ’ s the first thing , making sure that we can wind down one firm if it gets into trouble without bringing the whole system down or forcing taxpayers to fund a bailout .
these are people only believe in jihad . they don ’ t want our system . they don ’ t want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life . they have no respect for human life .
he looked at me , goes , `` i — i hope you ’ re kidding when you say that . they conceived of the idea and they started digging four hours later , ok ? there is no , you know , go through 25 years of environmental impact , you are going to hurt the snail . you ’ re going to hurt this . you are going to — they are doing a big thing .
and when the cornerstone of this very building was put in place , president truman came here to new york and said , `` the united nations is essentially an expression of the moral nature of man ’ s aspirations . '' the moral nature of man ’ s aspirations . as we live in a world that is changing at a breathtaking pace , that ’ s a lesson that we must never forget .
you have a place here in america . you have a place in those countries where you live . you have a future ultimately , those are the antidotes to violent extremism . and that 's work that we 're going to have to do together . it will take time . this is a generational challenge . but after 238 years , it should be obvious -- america has overcome much bigger challenges , and we ’ ll overcome the ones that we face today . we will stay united and committed to the ideals that have shaped us for more than two centuries , including the opportunity and justice and dignity of every single human being .
this was rubio that said , `` he has small hands and you know what that means . '' okay ? so , he started it . so , what i said a couple of days later ... and what happened is i was on line shaking hands with supporters , and one of supporters got up and he said , `` mr. trump , you have strong hands .
any successful strategy , though , also needs strong regional partners . i ’ m encouraged so far that countries in the region -- countries that don ’ t always agree on many things -- increasingly recognize the primacy of the threat that isil poses to all of them . and i ’ ve asked secretary kerry to travel to the region to continue to build the coalition that ’ s needed to meet this threat . as i ’ ve said , rooting out a cancer like isil will not be quick or easy , but i ’ m confident that we can -- and we will -- working closely with our allies and our partners .
i welcome this debate . and i think it 's healthy for our democracy . i think it 's a sign of maturity , because probably five years ago , six years ago , we might not have been having this debate . and i think it 's interesting that there are some folks on the left but also some folks on the right who are now worried about it who were n't very worried about it when there was a republican president . i think that 's good that we 're having this discussion .
but you 're going to call up -- good man . but you 're going to call him and you could either say , governor , or vice president , sir , please , please speak to mr. trump .
and both of us wished we had some superpower that would let us be in two places at once . but we persisted . we made that marriage work and the reason michelle had the strength to juggle everything , and put up with me and eventually the public spotlight , was because she , too , came from a family of folks who didn ’ t quit -- because she saw her dad get up and go to work every day even though he never finished college , even though he had crippling ms. she saw her mother , even though she never finished college , in that school , that urban school , every day making sure michelle and her brother were getting the education they deserved . michelle saw how her parents never quit . they never indulged in self-pity , no matter how stacked the odds were against them . they did n't quit .
most of importantly , favorability – no , i still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50 % to 39 % , which is good , and i beat hillary in the fox poll as you see very easily 46 % to 41 % . that ’ s ultimately the most important .
i 've said in the state of the union and i 'll repeat here today : i am willing and happy to look at other ideas to improve the law , including incentives to improve patient safety and medical malpractice reforms . and i want to correct a flaw that 's already placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on too many small businesses , and i appreciate the chamber 's help in doing that .
we don ’ t yet have all the answers . but we do know that multiple people have been wounded , some gravely , in explosions at the boston marathon . i ’ ve spoken to fbi director mueller and secretary of homeland security napolitano , and they ’ re mobilizing the appropriate resources to investigate and to respond .
thank you . yet hillary clinton , for months , and despite so many attacks , repeatedly refused to even say the words radical islam until i challenged her yesterday . and , guess what , she will probably say them . she sort of has said them , but let ’ s see what happens . she really has no choice , but she doesn ’ t want to .
but we see by the lines – the lines go down to park avenue . they ’ ve been forming since last night and i ’ m going to be signing books starting at 12 p.m. we ’ re doing a couple of interviews and then we ’ re signing books starting at 12 p.m. and that ’ ll be very exciting for me .
then soon after , cory served on his 10th deployment since 9/11 -- that 's right , his 10th deployment . and that 's when an ied nearly took his life . the traumatic brain injury was severe . cory was in a coma for months . it seemed possible that he would never wake up .
i mean , they allowed – in one night , that first night in baltimore – they allowed that city to be destroyed . and they set it back 35 years . one night . because the police were not allowed to protect people . they weren ’ t allowed to protect people .
and that 's what we ended up getting -- the king of teleprompters . but , so when i look at these things here i say you know what , it 's so much easier , it would be so nice , just bah , pa , bah , pa , bah , bing , bing , bing .
this is no way to run the greatest country on earth . it ’ s a dangerous game that we ’ ve never played before , and we can ’ t afford to play it now . not when the jobs and livelihoods of so many families are at stake . we can ’ t allow the american people to become collateral damage to washington ’ s political warfare .
after all , our brave servicemen and women and their families have done everything they ’ ve been asked to do . they have been everything that we have asked them to be . “ if i am a hero , ” sal has said , “ then every man who stands around me , every woman in the military , every person who defends this country is. ” and he ’ s right .
this is a tough time for a lot of people -- millions of folks all across the eastern seaboard . but america is tougher , and we ’ re tougher because we pull together . we leave nobody behind . we make sure that we respond as a nation and remind ourselves that whenever an american is in need , all of us stand together to make sure that we ’ re providing the help that 's necessary .
through this plan we are setting an ambitious goal : all students should graduate from high school prepared for college and a career -- no matter who you are or where you come from . achieving this goal will be difficult . it will take time . and it will require the skills , talents , and dedication of many : principals , teachers , parents , students . but this effort is essential for our children and for our country . and while there will always be those cynics who claim it can ’ t be done , at our best , we know that america has always risen to the challenges that we ’ ve faced . this challenge is no different .
[ comment on a supporter ’ s sign ] you know this is a movement , folks . this is not like maybe even about me . i don ’ t want it to be about me . this is about common sense . it ’ s about doing the right thing .
it 's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago , and went on to wage a revolution and they founded this nation . young people . students who sat where you sit 75 years ago who overcame a depression and won a world war ; who fought for civil rights and put a man on the moon . students who sat where you sit 20 years ago who founded google and twitter and facebook and changed the way we communicate with each other .
and i say why ? why aren ’ t they flying at least the same plane ? now , i know what those suckers cost because i happen to have one of them right ? so i know what it costs to operate these planes…more importantly , the time and the energy . but i would have said ellen or i would have said whoever was doing the show , `` let ’ s do it from the white house . '' this way , i take a half and hour , i go back , i don ’ t spend any money of the taxpayers .
so that ’ s how our fiscal challenge was created . that ’ s how we got here . and now that our economic recovery is gaining strength , democrats and republicans must come together and restore the fiscal responsibility that served us so well in the 1990s . we have to live within our means . we have to reduce our deficit , and we have to get back on a path that will allow us to pay down our debt . and we have to do it in a way that protects the recovery , protects the investments we need to grow , create jobs , and helps us win the future .
but one of the things we ’ re going to do with the va , we have a lot of hospitals that aren ’ t doing any business . we have a lot of private doctors that could do more business .
as soon as next week , every senator will get to vote on whether or not we should crack down on folks who buy guns as part of a scheme to arm criminals . that would keep more guns off the streets and out of the hands of people who are intent on doing harm . and it would make life a whole lot easier and safer for the people behind me -- police officers .
today , whether you live in downtown manhattan or in my grandmother ’ s village more than 200 miles from nairobi , you can hold in your hand more information than the world ’ s greatest libraries . together , we ’ ve learned how to cure disease and harness the power of the wind and the sun . the very existence of this institution is a unique achievement -- the people of the world committing to resolve their differences peacefully , and to solve their problems together . i often tell young people in the united states that despite the headlines , this is the best time in human history to be born , for you are more likely than ever before to be literate , to be healthy , to be free to pursue your dreams .
even a single individual can be devastating , just look at what happened in orlando . can you imagine large groups ? truly , our president does n't know what he is doing . he has failed us , and failed us badly , and under his leadership , this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse .
we reform agricultural subsidies -- subsidies that a lot of times pay large farms for crops that they do n't grow . we make modest adjustments to federal retirement programs . we reduce by tens of billions of dollars the tax money that goes to fannie mae and freddie mac .
she had heard me speak about my mother having cancer and having to worry about maybe not getting the health care she needed because of a preexisting condition , and she had connected with that .
now we owe it to the chinese , a lot of it . we owe it to other countries . they 're the ones that hold the debt . and then we give them money .
and when there is a problem , as bad as these two situations were , and i personally think they were , they were bad . i hated , i hated watching it . but as bad as they were , they get broadcast all over the world for days and days , and all of the good things which are magnified thousands of times , nobody talks about .
if we can – you know , we have a movement going on , folks . and it ’ s a movement of intelligence , actually . it ’ s a movement of common sense . that ’ s all it is .
and if they bring it back , they ’ ll be using it to invest in our country . i mean , a lot of good things will happen . i happen to believe it ’ s more than $ 2.5 trillion .
remember this : our educational system is a mess . we spend more money per pupil as a government than any other country in the world and we ’ re in 28th place . and i mean like double what anybody else pays .
no single individual built america on their own . we built it together . we have been , and always will be , one nation , under god , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all ; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another . and members of congress , it is time for us to meet our responsibilities .
all right , so that 's a big chunk of this first part of this initiative . the second part : we 're going to back $ 10 billion in loans to renovate and rebuild college classrooms and buildings all across the country .
now , i want to acknowledge -- because this looks like a very well-read and informed crowd -- that there have been a bunch of critics about trade deals generally and the trans-pacific partnership . and what ’ s interesting is typically they ’ re my friends , coming from my party , and they ’ re my fellow travelers on minimum wage and on job training and on clean energy . on every progressive issue , they ’ re right there with me . and then on this one , they ’ re like whooping on me .
think about that . if you buy a car and you ’ ve got a car note , you do not save money by not paying your car note . you ’ re just a deadbeat . if you buy a house , you don ’ t save money by not authorizing yourself to pay the mortgage . you ’ re just going to be foreclosed on your home . that ’ s what this is about .
i ’ ve turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because it ’ s not the right thing . it ’ s just not right . and that seems to be resonating very strongly .
and when they met again that winter evening in 1955 , rosa parks would not be pushed . when the driver got up from his seat to insist that she give up hers , she would not be pushed . when he threatened to have her arrested , she simply replied , “ you may do that. ” and he did .
to those who voted for someone else in either party , i will work hard to earn your support and i will work very hard to earn that support . to all of those bernie sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates , we welcome you with open arms . and by the way , the terrible trade deals that bernie was so vehemently against and he ’ s right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that ’ s what i do . we are going to have fantastic trade deals . we ’ re going to start making money and bringing in jobs .
and by the way , outside you have a few people picketing . they ’ re sent there by hillary clinton and they ’ re picketing that the money wasn ’ t sent . the money has all been sent .
mexico also took a big plant out of tennessee and tennessee thought they were going to get it and they didn ’ t . i want the motor companies , as you would say , or the automobile companies to build their plants in the united states .
and it ’ s almost like they answer me and they say , `` we don ’ t know . he comes to new york . we don ’ t know . we don ’ t know . '' i said he ’ s a disaster .
so south korea — i order televisions , i order thousands of televisions a year . i order televisions because i have a lot of stuff and i like nice brand new — they ’ re all made in south korea , most — other than sony , and sony , in all fairness , has lost its way .
so we must be honest with ourselves . in recent years we 've allowed our alliance to drift . i know that there have been honest disagreements over policy , but we also know that there 's something more that has crept into our relationship .
so we have to fight for the second amendment . it ’ s so simple . it ’ s so simple . and believe me , believe me , they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and they ’ re going to have them more so than ever before . so we ’ re going to protect the second amendment if i ’ m president . that i can tell you .
that ’ s the magic of the senate . that ’ s the essence of what it can be . and who but ted kennedy , and his family , would create a full-scale replica of the senate chamber , and open it to everyone ?
i want to tell you , a lot of bernie sanders people are so upset about it , they are going to be voting for trump . i really believe that . they 're going to be voting for trump .
we do know that peace can not come to a land that has known so much war without a political settlement . so as we strengthen the afghan government and security forces , america will join initiatives that reconcile the afghan people , including the taliban . our position on these talks is clear : they must be led by the afghan government , and those who want to be a part of a peaceful afghanistan must break from al qaeda , abandon violence , and abide by the afghan constitution . but , in part because of our military effort , we have reason to believe that progress can be made .
i make that commitment tonight . earlier , i asked ray mabus , the secretary of the navy , who is also a former governor of mississippi and a son of the gulf coast , to develop a long-term gulf coast restoration plan as soon as possible . the plan will be designed by states , local communities , tribes , fishermen , businesses , conservationists and other gulf residents . and bp will pay for the impact this spill has had on the region .
and while that decline was devastating , the consequences of the credit crisis that caused it will be even worse if we do not act now . we 're in a very dangerous situation , where financial institutions across this country are afraid to lend money . and if all that meant was the failure of a few banks in new york , that would be one thing . but that 's not what it means . what it means is , if we do n't act , it will be harder for americans to get a mortgage for their home or loans they need to buy a car or send their children to college .
in syria , the future must not belong to a dictator who massacres his people . if there is a cause that cries out for protest in the world today , peaceful protest , it is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment buildings . and we must remain engaged to assure that what began with citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence .
and unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals , we ’ re being eaten alive . that ’ s why when you look at the phony numbers , we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren ’ t working . our real unemployment rate is probably 30 % . it ’ s not 5.3 % . that was done for politicians so they ’ d look good . it ’ s not 5.3 % . how can you have 5.3 % when you have 100 million people ?
and after four or five years in brooklyn , i ventured into manhattan and did a lot of great deals — the grand hyatt hotel . i was responsible for the convention center on the west side . i did a lot of great deals , and i did them early and young . and now i ’ m building all over the world , and i love what i ’ m doing .
and keep in mind that when we started this process off , even with the interim agreement , when we signed the jpoa way back at the beginning of this whole thing , there was a similar back-and-forth in terms of interpretation of how this was going to be implemented .
i ’ ve been involved in many fundraisers . there are many scammers out there . he did the right thing by vetting these groups there . if you look at some of the groups , they ’ re given 20 cents , 40 cents on the dollar and they ’ re spending the rest for you know their nice lavish trips . he gave 100 % .
for that reason , the new presidential directive that i ’ ve issued today will clearly prescribe what we do , and do not do , when it comes to our overseas surveillance . to begin with , the directive makes clear that the united states only uses signals intelligence for legitimate national security purposes , and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary folks . i ’ ve also made it clear that the united states does not collect intelligence to suppress criticism or dissent , nor do we collect intelligence to disadvantage people on the basis of their ethnicity , or race , or gender , or sexual orientation , or religious beliefs . we do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to u.s. companies or u.s. commercial sectors .
…and by the way , some of the media ’ s terrific but most of it 70 % , 75 % is absolute dishonest , absolute scum . remember that . scum . scum . they ’ re totally dishonest people .
and i ’ m not going to beat around the bush and `` oh , let ’ s talk and let ’ s be nice and let ’ s say – `` nobody can do it like i do it . nobody . honestly , nobody .
this is an exact quote . i have like this photographic memory so i don ’ t need – but i want to be sure because if i used the word `` the '' incorrectly , they ’ ll say , `` he didn ’ t – ``
but it had taken me back to june 16th . i was told `` don ’ t even go to iowa . start right here in new hampshire . just don ’ t waste your – ``
i think it is incredible . she did a great job on that . i think it is her greatest achievement . i think when they look back on hillary clinton , they will say the greatest achievement of hillary clinton was getting out of this problem with e-mail tz .
we need to tell the truth also about how radical islam is coming to our shores . and it ’ s coming ... with these people , folks , it ’ s coming . we ’ re importing radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president . even our own fbi director has admitted that we can not effectively check the backgrounds of people we ’ re letting into america . all of the september 11th hijackists were issued visas . large numbers of somali refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis .
we ’ re not going to be where china made last year trade deficits $ 505 billion . japan over $ 100 billion . mexico $ 58 billion . we ’ re going to build a wall and mexico is going to pay for the wall . okay ?
in the face of the world ’ s condemnation , qaddafi chose to escalate his attacks , launching a military campaign against the libyan people . innocent people were targeted for killing . hospitals and ambulances were attacked . journalists were arrested , sexually assaulted , and killed . supplies of food and fuel were choked off . water for hundreds of thousands of people in misurata was shut off . cities and towns were shelled , mosques were destroyed , and apartment buildings reduced to rubble . military jets and helicopter gunships were unleashed upon people who had no means to defend themselves against assaults from the air .
third , this plan would enact the strongest consumer financial protections ever . and that 's absolutely necessary because this financial crisis wasn ’ t just the result of decisions made in the executive suites on wall street ; it was also the result of decisions made around kitchen tables across america , by folks who took on mortgages and credit cards and auto loans . and while it ’ s true that many americans took on financial obligations that they knew or should have known they could not have afforded , millions of others were , frankly , duped . they were misled by deceptive terms and conditions , buried deep in the fine print .
and you say that . we have to get our prisoners back . day one . they ’ re going to say , `` no , we ’ re not giving . '' and we ’ re going to say , `` bye bye . bye ! call us when you ’ re ready . '' and then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions . i guarantee you within 48 hours they ’ re calling , begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back . it ’ s so easy .
now , as of september , the new health care law prohibits insurance companies from dropping people ’ s coverage when they get sick , which is critical to giving people some peace of mind . but when news reports indicated that an insurance company was dropping the coverage of women diagnosed with breast cancer , my administration called on them to end the practice immediately -- don ’ t wait till september . and soon after , the entire industry announced that it would comply with the new law early and stop this perverse practice of dropping people ’ s insurance when they fall ill and when they need coverage the most .
you take a look at germany , you take a look at sweden , you take a look at brussels . you look at some of these places , it ’ s like a disaster .
so , again , you ’ re not going to support me even though you know i ’ m the best thing that could ever happen to israel and i ’ ll be that . i know why you ’ re not going to support me and you know you ’ re not going to support me because i don ’ t want your money . isn ’ t it crazy ? no , it ’ s true .
here , for thousands of years , the people of this land have journeyed from tribe to principality to nation-state ; through reformation and enlightenment , renowned as a “ land of poets and thinkers , ” among them immanuel kant , who taught us that freedom is the “ unoriginated birthright of man , and it belongs to him by force of his humanity . ”
